# JustGiving - Code Test


**********

## Thanks for taking the time to look at this repo.


This is my test submission for the Front-End Developer role at JustGiving, to get started please run the following commands in the terminal:

to install dependancies -- `$ yarn`

to run tests -- `$ yarn test`

to start the project -- `$ yarn start`


I really enjoyed working on this test as it gave me exposure to implementing tests for the various components (even though they mught not be 100% right), and it was just really fun to do.

***********

### Project Setup:

I setup the project from scratch, without the create react-app command, as per instructions in the repo.

I made the care button clickable which updates the state to show that you liked it, and also the ability to unlike it, similar to how the current website works.

I've setup tests as well - this is the first time i've done this, so i'm hoping thaht they've been done correctly and what you were expecting. Definitely keen to focus on this more in the future.


************

### Take-aways and future development:
1. I would have liked to have implemented some more features like the abillity to add a donation, that gets stored in localStorage and updates the state.
2. I would have definitely made it responsive - it's not reponsive at all right now.
3. To implement more tests, and to start building the tests before building the components - (i know i did it the wrong way around, but I wanted to get this finished before getting stuck on tests) üôÇ

Again, thank you in advance for taking the time to look at this test, and for giving me the opportunity to take part in this.

Cheers
